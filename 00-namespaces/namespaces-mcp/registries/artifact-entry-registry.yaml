# MCP Level 1 Artifact Entry Registry
# Defines artifact instance identifiers and versioning

description: |
  Artifact Entry Registry manages unique identifiers for artifact instances,
  version control, and semantic type classification for all MCP artifacts.

naming_format:
  pattern: "{artifact-type}-{purpose}"
  rules:
    - "Artifact names must be lowercase with hyphens"
    - "Must include semantic type descriptor"
    - "Support version suffixes (e.g., artifact-name@v1.0.0)"
  examples:
    - "manifest.yaml"
    - "schema.json"
    - "spec.yaml"
    - "governance.yaml"
    - "communication.manifest.yaml"
    - "data-management.schema.yaml"
