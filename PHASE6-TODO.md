# Phase 6: Flow Definitions - TODO

## Objective
Create 8 flow files defining workflow orchestration and execution patterns for each engine.

## Progress Tracking

### 1. RAG Engine [x]
- [x] rag-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 2. DAG Engine [x]
- [x] dag-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 3. Governance Engine [x]
- [x] governance-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 4. Taxonomy Engine [x]
- [x] taxonomy-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 5. Execution Engine [x]
- [x] execution-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 6. Validation Engine [x]
- [x] validation-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 7. Promotion Engine [x]
- [x] promotion-engine.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

### 8. Artifact Registry [x]
- [x] artifact-registry.flow.yaml - Workflow definitions and orchestration

## Completion Status
- Total Files: 8/8 (100%)
- Estimated Lines: ~3,200 lines (~400 per file)

## Flow File Structure
Each flow file should include:
- Workflow definitions (sequential, parallel, conditional)
- Step-by-step execution flows
- Input/output specifications
- Error handling and retry logic
- Timeout configurations
- Conditional branching
- Integration patterns
- Event triggers
- State management
