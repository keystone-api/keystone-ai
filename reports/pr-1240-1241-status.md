# PR #1240 / PR #1241 Status Check

| PR | Title (from GitHub) | Status | Merged At (UTC) | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #1240 | feat: MCP Level 4 Phase 1 Foundation - Core Interfaces & Architecture | Merged | 2026-01-11T03:37:13Z | Present locally via merge commit `4a74a6b` (source branch `test-root-governance`). Large governance/config footprint landed. |
| #1241 | feat: MCP Level 4 Phase 3 - Advanced Engines Complete (8/8 modules) | Merged | 2026-01-11T03:36:53Z | GitHub shows merged to `main`; commit not present in current shallow history. Need fetch/full sync to confirm artifacts locally. |

## Findings
- Local history contains PR #1240; artifacts include expanded governance assets, AI behavior contract docs, and extensive test suites.
- PR #1241 is reported merged on GitHub but is absent from the current checked-out history. Additional fetch from `origin/main` is required to surface its commits in this workspace.

## Recommended Improvements
1. Fetch full `main` history to align workspace with PR #1241 content (`git fetch origin main --depth=1000` then rebase/merge as appropriate).
2. Once history is complete, rerun targeted validation (governance/config parsers and unit suites added in PR #1240) to ensure compatibility with PR #1241 payloads.
3. Track any conflicting assets between #1240 and #1241 (especially governance YAML and test matrices) before promotion.
