"""
Event and Job Orchestration System

This is the critical infrastructure for "strong gate + reporting":
- Event Log: Webhook events are persisted first, enabling replay and audit
- Job Queue: Separate queues for gate (high priority) and report (low priority)
- Idempotency: Same PR/commit webhook resend won't cause duplicate runs
- Retry/DLQ: Controlled retry for tool/provider failures
- State Machine: Run lifecycle tracking (queued → running → completed/failed)
