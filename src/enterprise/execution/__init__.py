"""
Execution Isolation and Security Module

Since we run code/content from external repos, isolation is critical:
- Container isolation: Each analysis runs in an isolated container
- Network restrictions: Egress deny by default
- Resource quotas: CPU/Memory/Time limits
- Secrets management: KMS/Vault/Secret Manager integration
- Supply chain security: Traceable worker images with SBOM and signatures
