                <h2>What is Agentic AI?</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Imagine having a highly capable assistant who doesn't just answer your questions but can actually take action on your behalf. That's the essence of agentic AI. Unlike traditional AI that primarily responds to commands or generates content, agentic AI can set goals, make decisions, and execute tasks with minimal human intervention.</p>
                    
                    <p>Think of it this way: regular AI is like a knowledgeable librarian who can find information for you. Agentic AI is like a skilled project manager who not only finds information but also organizes it, creates plans, and carries out tasks to achieve specific objectives.</p>
                    
                    <p>Agentic AI represents a significant leap forward in artificial intelligence. These systems can reason through complex problems, use various tools and applications, and learn from their experiences to improve over time. They operate with a higher degree of autonomy, making them incredibly valuable for businesses and individuals alike.</p>
                    
                    <p>The technology is built on advanced components including perception (gathering information), reasoning (analyzing data), planning (developing strategies), action (executing tasks), and reflection (learning from results). This continuous cycle allows agentic AI to handle multi-step tasks that previously required extensive human oversight.</p>
                    
                    <p>What makes agentic AI truly revolutionary is its ability to coordinate multiple specialized agents working together. Just as a successful company relies on different departments with distinct skills, agentic AI systems can deploy various agents—each specializing in specific tasks—to accomplish complex objectives efficiently and effectively.</p>

            <!-- How It Works Section -->
            <section id="how-it-works" class="how-it-works">
                <h2>How Agentic AI Works</h2>
                <p>Agentic AI operates through a sophisticated process that mimics human problem-solving. Let's break it down into five simple steps:</p>
                
                <div class="steps-grid">
                    <div class="step-card">
                        <div class="step-number">1</div>
                        <h4>Perception</h4>
                        <p>The AI gathers information from various sources like databases, documents, emails, or sensors. It analyzes this data to understand the situation and identify what needs to be done.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="step-card">
                        <div class="step-number">2</div>
                        <h4>Reasoning</h4>
                        <p>Using advanced language models, the AI analyzes the gathered information to understand context, identify relevant details, and figure out potential solutions to the problem.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="step-card">
                        <div class="step-number">3</div>
                        <h4>Planning</h4>
                        <p>The AI develops a clear plan by setting specific goals, breaking them down into smaller steps, and determining the best approach to achieve them efficiently.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="step-card">
                        <div class="step-number">4</div>
                        <h4>Action</h4>
                        <p>Based on its plan, the AI takes action by performing tasks, making decisions, or interacting with other systems and applications to move toward the goal.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="step-card">
                        <div class="step-number">5</div>
                        <h4>Reflection</h4>
                        <p>After taking action, the AI learns from the results, evaluates whether its actions were successful, and uses this feedback to improve its future performance.</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 40px; text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; color: var(--text-dark);">
                    This continuous cycle of perception, reasoning, planning, action, and reflection enables agentic AI to handle increasingly complex tasks while continuously improving its capabilities.
