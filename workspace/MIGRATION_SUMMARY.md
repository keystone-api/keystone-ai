**Date**: 2026-01-08  
**Status**: ASSESSMENT COMPLETE - AWAITING APPROVAL  
**Recommendation**: PROCEED WITH FULL INTEGRATION (OPTION 1)

---

## 🎯 Quick Overview

### What We're Migrating
- **Source**: `workspace/docs/refactor_playbooks/`
- **Target**: `00-namespaces/namespaces-mcp/refactor_playbooks/`
- **Size**: 107 files, 1.9 MB
- **Type**: Three-phase refactor system (解構-集成-重構)

### Why We're Migrating
1. ✅ Achieve "single source of truth" consolidation under namespace-mcp
2. ✅ Align with namespace governance architecture
3. ✅ Support INSTANT execution standards
4. ✅ Eliminate scattered naming/refactor documentation
5. ✅ Enable future optimization and evolution

### Migration Approach
**Option 1: Full Integration** (RECOMMENDED)
- Move entire refactor_playbooks directory to namespace-mcp
- Preserve all documentation and history
- Update all path references
- Integrate with namespace-mcp indices

## 💡 Key Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation: PROCEED WITH OPTION 1

**Rationale**:
1. ✅ Aligns with namespace-mcp's "single source of truth" philosophy
2. ✅ Preserves all valuable documentation and history
3. ✅ Maintains clear structure and organization
4. ✅ Low-medium risk with comprehensive mitigation
5. ✅ Estimated 4-day effort is justified by long-term benefits

### Alternative Options (If Needed)

**Option 2: Selective Integration**
- Extract only essential components
- Archive completed/historical items
- Higher complexity, longer timeline

**Option 3: Index-Only Integration**
- Keep in current location
- Add to namespace-mcp index only
- Doesn't achieve true consolidation
