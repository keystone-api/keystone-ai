}, {
  timezone: 'UTC',
  priority: 'high',
  maxRetries: 3
});
```

**One-Time Tasks**:
```typescript
scheduler.scheduleOnce('cleanup', new Date('2026-01-01'), async () => {
  await cleanupOldData();
});
```

**Interval Tasks**:
```typescript
scheduler.scheduleInterval('health-check', 60000, async () => {
  await checkSystemHealth();
});
```

**Management Operations**:
- `pauseJob(name)` - Pause a scheduled job
- `resumeJob(name)` - Resume a paused job
- `deleteJob(name)` - Delete a job permanently
- `getJob(name)` - Get job details
- `listJobs()` - List all jobs
- `getJobHistory(name)` - Get execution history

**Technical Stack**:
- node-cron for cron parsing and scheduling
- BullMQ for distributed job queue
- Redis for job persistence and queue
- Winston for logging
- cron-parser for expression validation

**Configuration Options**:
- Maximum concurrent jobs: 10 (configurable)

- ✅ Input validation ready (Zod)
- ✅ Error sanitization

### Planned for Production:
- [ ] API key rotation
- [ ] OAuth2 integration
- [ ] TLS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Security audit logging
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] DDoS protection

## Testing

### Current Status:
- Unit tests: To be implemented
- Integration tests: To be implemented
- E2E tests: To be implemented
- Load tests: To be implemented

### Recommended Testing Strategy:
- Jest for unit tests (80%+ coverage target)
- Supertest for API integration tests
- Playwright for dashboard E2E tests
- k6 or Artillery for load testing

## Deployment

### Development:
```bash
# Dashboard
cd apps/web
npm run dev

# API Gateway
cd services/api-gateway
npm run dev

# Scheduler
cd services/scheduler
npm run dev
```

### Production Build:
```bash
# Build all services
npm run build --workspaces

# Or build individually
cd services/api-gateway && npm run build
cd services/scheduler && npm run build
cd apps/web && npm run build
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Authentication**: Current implementation uses mock user database. Production should integrate with PostgreSQL or similar.

2. **WebSocket**: Real-time updates in dashboard use polling. WebSocket to be implemented in Phase 3.

3. **Scheduler Persistence**: Job definitions are in-memory. Should persist to database for production.

4. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI spec is basic. Needs enhancement with full request/response schemas.

5. **Monitoring**: Basic metrics implemented. Phase 2 will add comprehensive observability.

## Conclusion

Phase 1 has successfully delivered all planned features:
- ✅ Web dashboard with real-time monitoring
- ✅ REST API gateway for external integrations
- ✅ Advanced scheduler with cron support

The foundation is now in place for Phase 2 (Q2 2026) to build upon with distributed deployment, ML optimization, and advanced analytics.
